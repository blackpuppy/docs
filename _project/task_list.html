      Note:
      <ol>
        <li>The main necessasity is to avoid duplicate work!</li>
        <li>This only reflects what's going on now, that is, who is working on which item.</li>
        <li>This is not a history.  The complete history can be found in git's log.</li>
        <li>Please pick up your item(s), and fill in your name.</li>
        <li>If it's a new item, you can just leave Task blank because usually you are going to finish all tasks.  Otherwise, please fill in the particular tasks you are going to do.  This is to reflect the progress.</li>
        <li>After done with the item, please clear your name and finished task(s) for the item.</li>
        <li>You can always pick up any "finished" item to proofread or make other improvement because the work is collectively owned by the whole team.  Of course, you are recommended to discuss with the original translator.</li>
        <li>The items will be numbered like chapter/section/subsection structure according to their appearance in <a href="http://book.cakephp.org/2.0/en/contents.html">CakePHP Cookbook</a>.  For example, <a href="http://book.cakephp.org/2.0/en/models.html">models</a> will be numbered 7, while <a href="http://book.cakephp.org/2.0/en/models/callback-methods.html">models\data-validations</a> will be numbered 7.5, and <a href="http://book.cakephp.org/2.0/en/models/data-validation/validating-data-from-the-controller.html">models\data-validation\validating-data-from-the-controller</a> will be numbered 7.5.1.</li>
        <li>The tasks for an item usually include translation, changing file extension from .rst to .md (just for better rendering on git.oschina.net and eventually will be renamed back before submitting to CakePHP team), and removing any unnecessary English text, making sure text is formatted according to <a href="http://book.cakephp.org/2.0/en/contributing/documentation.html">required format</a>, and if possible, proofreading and cross referencing other translation works (more on this later in other docs).</li>
        <li>You can use Remarks for any additional information you want to make the team know.</li>
